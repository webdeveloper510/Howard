         <p class="text-base mt-3 box p-2 text-danger"><b> Important tip: </b> Sometimes a full investigation and report cannot be done right away and there is limited information about the incident. In these instances, you should always submit a quick report with basic facts (employee name, short description, date,
           and any other details) about the incident so it can be submitted to the insurance carrier in a timely fashion. More information can always be added after the fact, but the report should always be submitted in a prompt manner. </p>

          <p class="text-base ml-3">⦁	The <b> immediate supervisor or manager </b> should report any injury or illness immediately (or when safe to do so) and complete the appropriate paperwork for safety team follow up, human resources actions, and insurance carrier needs. All injuries and illnesses should be reported, no matter how large or small.</p>
          <p class="text-base ml-3">⦁	Use the company Incident Reporting Form or the <a class="underline" href="https://www.osha.gov/harwoodgrants/grantmaterials/bytopic" > OSHA reporting form </a> that includes the employee’s report, the supervisor’s report, and the investigation report. Document the injury/illness completely while doing a thorough root cause analysis of the incident so that corrective action can be determined to prevent future incidents.
           <br/>
           ⦁	Review the incident investigation report with the safety committee and/or management to determine appropriate corrective action, training, or other changes in the safety program in that work area. Any corrective actions should be communicated clearly, with responsibility for follow up tasks assigned to the appropriate person(s), and adjustments made to the job hazard analysis if needed.
           <br/>
           ⦁	Part of the safety corrections may include employee coaching and counseling to correct unsafe behaviors, prevent injuries, and improve safety. Follow the company procedure for corrective action and focus on changing behavior instead of punishment. However, in some instances, after consultation with human resources and legal counsel, egregious or willfully negligent behavior may be cause for immediate disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.

      </div>
      <div id="Section-4" class="tab-pane leading-relaxed" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="Section-4">
        <h1 class="text-2xl font-medium leading-none my-3 text-center space">Hazard Prevention and Control</h1>
         <div class="saprater"></div>
         <p class="text-base text-center">Regular inspections and surveys, along with employee reports/feedback, allow us to keep hazard information current. With hazards continuously identified, they can be controlled or prevented using the following standard methods:</p>
        <div class="ml-4">
         
          <p class="text-base ml-3">⦁	Safe Work Practices. Implementation of special workplace rules may be necessary to continue to protect employees from hazards. Such special rules include specific procedures regarding the use of potentially hazardous equipment or materials, identification of safe acts or behaviors, lockout/tagout procedures, requirements for personal protective devices, and good housekeeping practices. The supervisor or safety representative will make sure that these special safety and health rules are written, posted,
             and discussed with affected employees.</p>
          <p class="text-base ml-3">⦁	Engineering Controls. The Company strives to ensure the work environment and the job itself are designed to eliminate or reduce employee exposure to hazards. This can be done by completely removing the hazard from facilities, equipment, or processes through design whenever possible. When hazards cannot be eliminated or replaced with less-hazardous alternatives, they may be enclosed. For example, moving parts of machinery or heat-producing processes may be enclosed with special materials. Finally, if hazards cannot be removed or enclosed, barriers will be put between employees and the hazards in the form of machine guards, ventilation hoods, or isolation of a process. These engineering controls will be regularly reviewed with affected employees.
            </p>
          <p class="text-base ml-3">⦁	Training. Employees are taught to identify and avoid hazards during orientation as well as ongoing safety training based on their position within the company and any potential hazards they may encounter during the course of their job. Managers and safety representatives will highlight safe work procedures and recognizing employees or groups of employees though our “catch me at my best” program, which demonstrates and enforces positive safety behaviors. Examples of these types of best safety practices include rewards for employees who are lifting properly, wearing the proper safety equipment, or making suggestions that
             are implemented and/or improve safety.
          </p>
          <p class="text-base ml-3">
            ⦁	Enforcement. Safe work practices are a condition of employment and any violation of workplace safety and health rules will be cause for corrective action, discipline, or termination of employment based on the seriousness of the violation. Enforcement will be based on letting employees know what is expected of them regarding workplace safety and health and giving them a chance to correct their own behavior. 
          </p>
          <p class="text-base ml-3">
            ⦁	Personal Protective Equipment. Engineering controls and safe work practices may not completely eliminate hazards. Personal protective equipment — such as face shields, steel-toed boots, safety glasses, or hardhats — may be required, and will be provided at no cost to the employees. Employees will be trained in the need for and proper use of such equipment and the limitations of this equipment will be made clear to all employees.
           </p>
          <p class="text-base ml-3">
            ⦁	Administrative Controls. Administrative controls such as lengthened rest breaks, additional relief workers, exercise breaks to various body motions, and rotation of workers through different jobs to reduce exposure to hazards may also be employed to help with the continuing control of hazards. Administrative controls should be used in conjunction with other controls that work to eliminate hazards and control exposure more directly.
           </p>
          <p class="text-base ml-3">
            ⦁	Preventive Maintenance. Preventive maintenance is designed to eliminate possible equipment problems and plays a major role in ensuring that hazard controls continue to function effectively and that equipment malfunctions do not cause additional hazards. Our preventive maintenance is continuous and performed in accordance with manufacturer’s recommendations. Records of all maintenance performed will be maintained by the appropriate designated safety personnel in their respective departments and kept on file in (list location), either by a computerized system or simply by dating the posted work schedule. We have to get with Dave & Mary Kay for this info.
          </p>
         <p class="text-base mt-3 box p-2 text-danger"><b> Important tip: </b> Reward programs should always be designed to incent the right safety behaviors, such as proper equipment operation and immediate reporting of injuries or illnesses. Accidents do happen, even with the most diligent safety protocols and training. Programs that incent employees not to report injuries or illnesses, such as incentives for hours worked without injury or no lost time accidents, may create employer problems with OSHA and insurance carriers.</p>

         <div class="saprater"></div>
         <p class="text-base text-center">Communication on safety issues is vital for the success of the program. Here are some of the ways the Company communicates with employees:</p>
        <div class="ml-4">
          <p class="text-base ml-3">⦁	Review of the safety program upon hiring or during onboarding orientation.</p>
          <p class="text-base ml-3">⦁	Training topics covered in classroom or tailgate talks/standup meetings.</p>
          <p class="text-base ml-3">⦁	Posters/signage/distributed content for compliance with all applicable state and federal regulations as well as company-specific exposures. </p>
          <p class="text-base ml-3">⦁	Safety meetings are held at least every _______________ (list days/month/quarter). The meetings may take place at different intervals if the occurrence of injuries and/or illnesses prompts immediate action. Copies of the safety meeting minutes are reviewed with follow up action planning.</p>
          <p class="text-base ml-3">⦁	If applicable, include other means used to ensure safety communications with employees.</p>
          <p class="text-base">The Company has instituted a procedure to communicate any hazards or safety issues without the fear of reprisal (anonymously if needed). In addition to communicating safety concerns with management or safety committee representatives directly, employees may submit their concerns through <b>  (list the types of communications methods you make available to your employees, such as the following: </b></p>
          <p class="text-base mt-5"><b>⦁	Safety suggestion boxes (include a list of locations).</b></p>
          <p class="text-base mt-3"><b>⦁	Telephone “care line.”</b></p>

          <p class="text-base mt-3 box p-2 text-danger">
            <b> Important tips: </b> All forms of safety communications must be in the language and vocabulary understandable to employees. Use color codes, posters, labels, or signs to warn employees of potential hazards. Provide employees with multiple ways to share concerns about unsafe working conditions, including standardized methods to document hazards, such as this form developed by <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/etools/09-031/IndHazCorRec.pdf" target="_blank" class="underline"> Cal/OSHA </a>.
