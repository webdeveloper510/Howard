        The HR training unit <a href="https://www.indeed.com/hire/c/info/5-steps-to-creating-an-effective-training-and-development-program?hl=en" class="underline" target="_blank"> develops a continuous training program </a>  for Modula’s employees to ensure their education and skills are current. Whether it’s offering a course on new manufacturing processes, new technologies or facilitating leadership training for supervisors, the training and development department provides access to materials for all employees. It coordinates with the compensation and benefits unit to reimburse the costs of external training that employees may incur. HR incorporates training and development planning in their normal activities by organizing new hire orientation, as well as introducing new employees to their colleagues and offering mentoring.

        HR manages payr  oll, payroll tax administration and benefits administration. Modula is extremely proud of the benefits package available to all employees.  HR organizes wages, insurance, holidays, and other perks for employees. Human resources personnel aim to meet employees’ needs while maintaining fairness and consistency in the organization. With this objective, the compensation and benefits component of the HR department explores, proposes, and manages new benefit options for employees.

        Employees can turn to HR for labor and employee relations issues whenever they have concerns and can rest assured the HR department will take necessary actions. For example, if an employee has issues communicating with management or a conflict with another employee, HR will mediate the situation and find solutions.

      <p class="text-base px-3">
        In the case of employee misconduct, HR will take actions to correct or reprimand the undesirable behavior or performance. The solutions can include a verbal or written warning, probation, suspension, or termination. Each instance is judged on a case-by-case basis, and the severity of the infraction dictates the administrative response.

        <a href="https://www.indeed.com/hire/c/info/new-hire-onboarding-checklist?hl=en" class="underline" target="_blank"> Onboarding </a> is the process of introducing and socializing a newly hired employee and can be broken into two categories. Formal onboarding is the process of taking the employee through the orientation and training processes. Informal onboarding involves helping them adjust to the environment and the expectations and requirements of their position. New hire onboarding can include assigning badges, equipment, and mentors.
