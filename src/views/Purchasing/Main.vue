           <h1 class="text-xl space font-medium mb-3">Acquiring Goods at the Best Possible Price</h1>
           <p class="space">The Purchasing departments must continuously evaluate materials based on quality and pricing. To maximize profitability, our Buyers need to procure goods efficiently. For example, buying small quantities from a large vendor is not economically practical. The procurement team must achieve
             bulk discounts on these orders and negotiate with alternate vendors for better pricing. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="intro-y col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 box p-5 text-center">
           <h1 class="text-xl font-medium space mb-3">Procuring Raw Materials for Sustaining Operations</h1>
           <p class="space">While procuring goods at the best price, the purchasing department must also maintain the purchases necessary for sustaining daily operations. From raw materials such as iron and plastic to machinery, production tools, 
            and even office supplies - they all need to be procured to keep the business running smoothly. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="intro-y col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 box p-5 text-center">
           <h1 class="text-xl font-medium space mb-3">Compliance with Industry Protocols</h1>
           <p class="space">In addition to sustaining operations, all goods and services procured by the purchasing department must also be compliant with industry standards and company policies. Vendors should ensure that the raw materials are good in quality before delivering large orders. The procurement department should also establish
             a specific purchasing policy that checks quality compliance at every level of the purchase.</p>

            <h1 class="text-xl space font-medium mb-3">Spending Limits</h1>
            <p class="space">The primary procurement policy of our Buyers is to purchase goods at the best prices. The purchasing department strictly defines & follows spending limits for every item in the order.
               This way, the purchasing department does not overspend or cut costs unnecessarily. </p>

        <div class="intro-y col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 box p-5 text-center">
            <h1 class="text-xl font-medium space mb-3">Authorized Vendors</h1>
            <p class="space">After determining the spending limits, the procurement procedure will also enlist all available authorized vendors. This list is maintained and updated regularly for ensuring access to the best vendors in the market. From large vendors to small-scale suppliers,
               all external parties involved in the procurement process are listed in the policy. </p>

             <h1 class="text-xl font-medium space mb-3">List of Supplies</h1>
             <p class="space">In addition to the list of vendors, the procurement policy also makes lists of the purchased items. Office supplies and other daily necessary items are listed together. Similarly, industrial goods and other items required in bulk orders are listed separately.
               These lists are appropriately categorized for making precise orders for every purchase unit. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="intro-y col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 box p-5 text-center">
             <h1 class="text-xl font-medium space mb-3">Prioritization</h1>
             <p class="space">While making these lists, the purchasing department should follow a prioritization policy set by the purchasing managers and key business stakeholders. This policy highlights the purchases that go first in the budget. Based on this, the list of supplies can be customized before allocating purchase orders

            <h1 class="text-xl font-medium space mb-3">Contract Negotiations Policies</h1>
            <p class="space">Once the purchase orders are ready, the organization should follow strict rules on pricing negotiations. Under these policies, the purchasing department should not focus on lower prices at the cost of quality. Instead,
               the quality of goods should be optimized with a pricing comparison among vendors. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="intro-y col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 box p-5 text-center">
            <h1 class="text-xl font-medium space  mb-3">Vendor Management</h1>
            <p class="space ">During these negotiations, vendors and suppliers should be managed properly. The procurement policy should emphasize the importance of efficient vendor management. Ensuring accurate order placements, issuing detailed purchase orders, and sending advance intimations for urgent purchases are some policies that the organization must follow. These will help in building and sustaining a reliable,
               profitable, and long-term business partnership with vendors while preventing vendor fraud. </p>

            <h1 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3 space ">Legal Liabilities</h1>
            <p class="space ">Throughout this procedure, the purchasing policy must also adhere to state and federal purchasing laws. Under these strict guidelines, the staff should work coherently with government agencies.
               These policies also help in preventing conflicts between an organization and its suppliers.</p>
